		  <h2>Contesting A Will</h2>
			  <p>Have you have been unfairly left out of a Will? Do you want to claim what is rightfully yours?</p>
			  <p>Losing a relative is one of the most difficult things any of us have to go through. The grieving process can be made even more difficult when there is a dispute over a Will. If you feel that you have been unfairly left out of a Will, have not been adequately provided for, or you are acting as an executor and somebody else is contesting the Will, our specialist team of lawyers can help you. And in most cases we can act for you on a “No Win No Fee” basis</p>
			  <h2>Reasons To Contest A Will</h2>
			  <p>There are a number of reasons to contest a Will, the following are the most common grounds for contesting a Will.</p>
				  <ul>
				  	<li>Lack of Testamentary Capacity. Where the testator lacked the mental capacity to write a will. This is very common with testators who have had dementia or have been under the influence of painkillers or medication that impacted their ability to make fluid independent decisions.</li>
				  	<li>Where money, property or other items were promised to you in return for maintenance but this has not been provided for within the will.</li>
				  	<li>Where money, property or other items were promised to you and in reliance on that promise you changed your position (for instance gave up work or your own home) to your detriment.</li>
				  	<li>Where you contest the legitimacy of the executor or where you believe that the executor is not serving the interests of the beneficiaries impartially.</li>
				  	<li>Instances where you believe that the will has been negligently or fraudulently written (for instance forged or perhaps signed and executed on a different date) – this is one of the most common legal scenarios.</li>
				  	<li>Where a Trustee is acting in his/her own self interest and in breach of the terms of the Trust and/or has failed to properly call in property belonging to the Trust, keep it safely and distribute it as per the Trust terms.</li>
				  </ul>
		  <h2>No Win No Fee</h2>
		  <p>In most cases we can work on a "No Win No Fee" basis. A "No Win No Fee" arrangement offers you an acceptable alternative to fund your Will claim. It does exactly what it says on the tin, a "fee" can only be raised if the Will contest or Will claim is successful.</p>
